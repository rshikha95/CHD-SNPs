# CHD-SNPs
This R code serves the purpose of systemetic SNP compilation, filtering based on Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) - associated traits, annotation, and integration with human heart organogenesis epigenetic data. The workflow includes the identification of potential CHD-associated enhancers, subsequent analysis for the identification of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) within these enhancers, and conservation analysis. The script further aims to pinpoint regulatory CHD-SNPs (rCHD-SNPs) using human heart eQTL data. To enhance the robustness of the findings, a cross-validation step with enhancers from the human enhancer disease database is incorporated. The final step involves the visualization of the results, offering a holistic view of the potential regulatory elements associated with Congenital Heart Disease.
